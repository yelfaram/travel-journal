# Scrimba - Travel Journal
This is my solution to the [Travel Journal solo project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

## Overview
This project helped me understand the following:
- Reusable Components
- Use of .map() and props

## React + Vite
This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
